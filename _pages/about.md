Hello, I'm Jash Bhatia, a master's student in Information Management and Data Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. Currently, I am working on developing AI-powered systems, including the integration of large language models for real-world applications.

<br> <br>

Previously, I interned at Tata Consultancy Services, where I developed live transcription models using advanced NLP techniques such as GPT-4 and T5, focusing on real-time speech processing. Additionally, I worked at Asset Villa as a Quantitative Research Intern, applying machine learning to analyze client behavior. I also hold a patent in computer vision for evaluating fruit freshness using AI, and have led projects like bird species classification using deep learning and heart disease prediction with machine learning. My work has been showcased in prominent AI and data science platforms.

<br><br>

When I’m not coding or researching, you can find me exploring sci-fi movies, brainstorming new AI applications, or geeking out over tech innovations. Feel free to connect if you'd like to discuss AI, data science, or potential collaborations!

<br><br>

I’m always open to research collaborations and discussions, so don’t hesitate to drop me an email if you’re interested in working together.
